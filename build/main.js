Burgess, this diagram offers a view of how redlining concentrated populations, and did so along a generally consistent pattern.</strong></p><p>According to Burgess, every city developed as a series of concentric circles.  Downtown business districts would be followed by factory zones.  Factory zones would transition to slums, followed then by progressively more affluent housing for working people and the investor class, before then reaching the final zone, from whence commuters came into the city. As the historian Elaine Lewinnek points out, \"Burgess adapted a half-century of Chicago maps and codified them in a model of abstraction and urban theory that has been called&#8212;with some hyperbole&#8212;'the most famous diagram in social science.'\"</p><p>In Burgess's model, each ring had cultural and economic features&#8212;features that he explicitly associated with ethnic and racial populations. Poor whites and black migrants occupied central slum districts rife with vice dens and run down rooming houses and immigrant colonies.  Second-generation European immigrants and factory and a shop workers, \"skilled and thrifty,\" lived on the outer edge of the slums and on the inner edge of the ring of well-kept apartment houses and \"workingmen's homes.\" Beyond them was the \"Promised Land\" of residential hotels and single-family homes.  In contrast to the swarthy, congested slums, these were \"bright light areas\" safely protected by restrictive covenants and high price points.</p><p>Burgess's model, in addition to reflecting the homes of real estate investor communities, served as an extension of wider segregationist thinking driving both sociology as a discipline and administrative practice during the progressive era.  Obsession with cities as \"organisms\" of society, they believed in what the sociologist Louis Wirth benignly described as the \"eugenics of the city.\"</p><p>Many of the HOLC maps reflected both the categorical impulse and spatial organization of Burgess model with D and C neighborhoods more likely to be located around central business districts and A and B neighborhoods in increasingly suburban peripheries.

		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> updates the study of New Deal America, the federal government, housing, and inequality for the twenty-first century. It offers unprecedented online access to the national collection of \"security maps\" and area descriptions produced between 1935 and 1940 by one of the New Deal's most important agencies, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation or HOLC (pronounced \"holk\"). </p>",
		"<p>HOLC recruited mortgage lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers in nearly 250 cities to create maps that color-coded credit worthiness and risk on neighborhood and metropolitan levels. These maps and their accompanying documentation helped set the rules for nearly a century of real estate practice. They have also served as critical evidence in countless urban studies in the fields of history, sociology, economics, and law.  Indeed, more than a half-century of research has shown housing to be for the twentieth century what slavery was to the antebellum period, namely the broad foundation of both American prosperity and racial inequality.  Through offering a digital library of the state's role in housing development, Mapping Inequality illustrates vividly the interplay between racism, administrative culture, economics, and the built environment.</p>",
		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> introduces viewers to the records of the Home Owners Loan Corporation with accessibility and on a scale that is unprecedented. Visitors can browse over two-hundred interactive maps and get a view of Depression-era America as developers, realtors, tax assessors, and surveyors saw it&#8212;a set of interlocking color-lines, racial groups, and environmental risks.  They can also use the maps and area descriptions to draw connections between past state actions (and inactions) and contemporary American problems.</p>",
		"<h3>Archiving Inequality for the Digital Age</h3>",
		"<p>Like so many other government agencies during the New Deal, HOLC and its parent bureau, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, shaped Americans' lives and livelihoods profoundly during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s. Both proved critical to protecting and expanding home ownership, to standardizing lending practices, and to encouraging residential and commercial real estate investment in a flagging economy.  Across the middle third of the twentieth century, arguably the most prosperous decades in American history, these agencies worked with public and private sector partners to create millions of jobs and help millions of Americans buy or keep their homes. At the very same time, federal housing programs helped codify and expand practices of racial and class segregation.  They ensured, moreover, that rampant real estate speculation and environmental degradation would accompany America's remarkable economic recovery and growth.</p>",
		"<p><cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> brings one of the country's most important archives to the public.  HOLC's documents contain a wealth of information about how government officials, lenders, and real estate interests surveyed and ensured the economic health of American cities.  And with the help of ongoing research, we continue to learn at what cost such measures were realized.</p>",
		"<p>Over the last thirty years especially, scholars have characterized HOLC's property assessment and risk management practices, as well as those of the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, and US. Housing Authority, as some of the most important factors in preserving racial segregation, intergenerational poverty, and the continued wealth gap between white Americans and most other groups in the U.S.  Many of these agencies operated under the influence of powerful real estate lobbies or wrote their policies steeped in what were, at the time, widespread assumptions about the profitability of racial segregation and the residential incompatibility of certain racial and ethnic groups.  Through HOLC, in particular, real estate appraisers used the apparent racial and cultural value of a community to determine its economic value.  <cite>Mapping Inequality</cite> offers a window into the New Deal era housing policies that helped set the course for contemporary America. This project provides visitors with a new view, and perhaps even a new language, for describing the relationship between wealth and poverty in America.</p>",

/**
 * Dispatcher is used to broadcast payloads to registered callbacks. This is
 * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:
 *
 *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is
 *      dispatched to every registered callback.
 *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have
 *      been executed.
 *
 * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which
 * selects a default city when a country is selected:
 *
 *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();
 *
 *   // Keeps track of which country is selected
 *   var CountryStore = {country: null};
 *
 *   // Keeps track of which city is selected
 *   var CityStore = {city: null};
 *
 *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city
 *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}
 *
 * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:
 *
 *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({
 *     actionType: 'city-update',
 *     selectedCity: 'paris'
 *   });
 *
 * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:
 *
 *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {
 *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {
 *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:
 *
 *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({
 *     actionType: 'country-update',
 *     selectedCountry: 'australia'
 *   });
 *
 * This payload is digested by both stores:
 *
 *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {
 *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {
 *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference
 * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee
 * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`
 * needs to query its data.
 *
 *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {
 *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {
 *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.
 *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);
 *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.
 *
 *       // Select the default city for the new country
 *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:
 *
 *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =
 *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {
 *       switch (payload.actionType) {
 *         case 'country-update':
 *         case 'city-update':
 *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);
 *           FlightPriceStore.price =
 *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);
 *           break;
 *     }
 *   });
 *
 * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'
 * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then
 * `FlightPriceStore`.

     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit chaining.
     * Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and functions can
     * be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value or may return a
     * primitive value will automatically end the chain returning the unwrapped
     * value. Explicit chaining may be enabled using `_.chain`. The execution of
     * chained methods is lazy, that is, execution is deferred until `_#value`
     * is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut
     * fusion is an optimization strategy which merge iteratee calls; this can help
     * to avoid the creation of intermediate data structures and greatly reduce the
     * number of iteratee executions.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `sort`,
     * `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`, `dropWhile`, `filter`,
     * `first`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `pluck`, `reject`, `rest`, `reverse`,
     * `slice`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, `toArray`,
     * and `where`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `at`, `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`,
     * `callback`, `chain`, `chunk`, `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `constant`,
     * `countBy`, `create`, `curry`, `debounce`, `defaults`, `defaultsDeep`,
     * `defer`, `delay`, `difference`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`,
     * `dropWhile`, `fill`, `filter`, `flatten`, `flattenDeep`, `flow`, `flowRight`,
     * `forEach`, `forEachRight`, `forIn`, `forInRight`, `forOwn`, `forOwnRight`,
     * `functions`, `groupBy`, `indexBy`, `initial`, `intersection`, `invert`,
     * `invoke`, `keys`, `keysIn`, `map`, `mapKeys`, `mapValues`, `matches`,
     * `matchesProperty`, `memoize`, `merge`, `method`, `methodOf`, `mixin`,
     * `modArgs`, `negate`, `omit`, `once`, `pairs`, `partial`, `partialRight`,
     * `partition`, `pick`, `plant`, `pluck`, `property`, `propertyOf`, `pull`,
     * `pullAt`, `push`, `range`, `rearg`, `reject`, `remove`, `rest`, `restParam`,
     * `reverse`, `set`, `shuffle`, `slice`, `sort`, `sortBy`, `sortByAll`,
     * `sortByOrder`, `splice`, `spread`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`,
     * `takeWhile`, `tap`, `throttle`, `thru`, `times`, `toArray`, `toPlainObject`,

     * `valuesIn`, `where`, `without`, `wrap`, `xor`, `zip`, `zipObject`, `zipWith`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that are **not** chainable by default are:
     * `add`, `attempt`, `camelCase`, `capitalize`, `ceil`, `clone`, `cloneDeep`,
     * `deburr`, `endsWith`, `escape`, `escapeRegExp`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`,
     * `findKey`, `findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `findLastKey`, `findWhere`, `first`,
     * `floor`, `get`, `gt`, `gte`, `has`, `identity`, `includes`, `indexOf`,

     * `isNative`, `isNaN`, `isNull`, `isNumber`, `isObject`, `isPlainObject`,
     * `isRegExp`, `isString`, `isUndefined`, `isTypedArray`, `join`, `kebabCase`,
